Baker Street Laboratory is a comprehensive framework for conducting AI-augmented research with full reproducibility, collaboration, and automation capabilities. Named after the famous detective's methodical approach to investigation, this system orchestrates multiple AI agents to gather, analyze, synthesize, and document research findings.

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Research Pipeline**: Orchestrated AI agents for data collection, analysis, and synthesis
- **Full Reproducibility**: Every research step is tracked, versioned, and reproducible
- **GitHub-Integrated Workflow**: Seamless integration with GitHub for collaboration and automation
- **Flexible Configuration**: YAML-based agent and pipeline configuration
- **Privacy-First Design**: Built-in data anonymization and security features
- **Automated Research Runs**: Scheduled research updates via GitHub Actions
- **Interactive & Batch Modes**: Support for both interactive exploration and automated pipelines

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YourOrg/Baker-Street-Laboratory.git
cd Baker-Street-Laboratory

# Run the installation script
./install.sh
```

### 2. Configuration

```bash
# Copy the environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your API keys
nano .env
```

Required API keys:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For GPT models
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - For Claude models (optional)
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - For search capabilities (optional)

### 3. Run Your First Research

```bash
# Interactive mode
./run.sh interactive

# Direct research query
./run.sh research "What are the latest developments in quantum computing?"

# Run a specific pipeline
./run.sh pipeline config/agents.yaml
```

## 🤖 Agent System

The framework includes several specialized AI agents:

- **Research Orchestrator**: Coordinates the overall research workflow
- **Data Collector**: Gathers information from various sources
- **Analyzer**: Performs data analysis and pattern recognition
- **Synthesizer**: Combines findings into coherent insights
- **Code Generator**: Creates implementation code based on research

Each agent is configurable via `config/agents.yaml` with customizable:
- Model selection (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claude, etc.)
- Temperature and token limits
- Capabilities and tools
- Role definitions

## 📊 GitHub Integration

Baker Street Laboratory leverages GitHub as the central hub for:

### Collaboration & Version Control
- **Branching Strategy**: Feature branches for new agents/capabilities
- **Pull Requests**: Code review and research discussion
- **Issue Tracking**: Research questions and enhancement requests

### Automation & CI/CD
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing on every PR
- **Scheduled Research**: Weekly automated research runs
- **Security Scanning**: Automated security and code quality checks

### Documentation & Transparency
- **Research Provenance**: Full history of research decisions
- **Reproducible Results**: Anyone can clone and reproduce findings
- **Living Documentation**: Wiki and GitHub Pages integration

## 🔄 Research Workflow

1. **Query Definition** → Define research questions in `research/01_initial_queries/`
2. **Data Collection** → Agents gather relevant information
3. **Analysis** → Statistical analysis and pattern recognition
4. **Synthesis** → Integration of findings into insights
5. **Documentation** → Generation of reports and documentation
6. **Review & Iteration** → Collaborative review via GitHub PRs

## 🛠️ Usage Examples

### Interactive Research Session
```bash
./run.sh interactive
🔍 Research Query: Analyze the impact of transformer architectures on NLP
```

### Automated Research Pipeline
```bash
# Trigger via GitHub Actions or locally
./run.sh research "Machine learning trends in healthcare 2024" --output-dir research/healthcare_2024
```

### Custom Agent Configuration
```yaml
# config/custom_agents.yaml
agents:
  domain_expert:
    type: "specialist"
    model: "gpt-4"
    temperature: 0.2
    role: "Domain-specific research specialist"
    capabilities:
      - "deep_domain_analysis"
      - "technical_validation"
```

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
