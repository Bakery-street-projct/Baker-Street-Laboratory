## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing: **security@boozelee.com**

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: What could an attacker accomplish with this vulnerability?
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: Operating system, Python version, Baker Street Laboratory version
- **Proof of Concept**: If applicable, include a minimal proof of concept

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: Varies based on complexity, typically 30-90 days

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **API Keys**: Never commit API keys to version control
   - Use `.env` files (already in `.gitignore`)
   - Rotate API keys regularly
   - Use environment-specific keys

2. **Database Security**: 
   - Keep your metadata database secure
   - Regular backups with encryption
   - Limit database access permissions

3. **Research Data**:
   - Be mindful of sensitive research data
   - Use data anonymization features
   - Follow your institution's data policies

4. **Dependencies**:
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Monitor security advisories
   - Use virtual environments

### For Contributors

1. **Code Review**: All code changes require review
2. **Dependency Updates**: Security-related dependency updates are prioritized
3. **Secrets Scanning**: Automated scanning prevents secret commits
4. **Static Analysis**: Code is automatically scanned for vulnerabilities
